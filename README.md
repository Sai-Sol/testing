# QuantumChain - Blockchain-Based Quantum Cloud Logging System

QuantumChain is a revolutionary blockchain-based quantum cloud logging system that solves the critical security problem of traditional quantum cloud platforms. By leveraging blockchain immutability, we ensure that quantum computations are tamper-proof and verifiable.

## 🔒 Problem Statement

Traditional quantum cloud logging systems lack security and can be tampered with. This creates significant trust issues where:
- Quantum computation results can be altered without detection
- No immutable audit trail exists for verification
- Users cannot independently verify computational integrity
- Centralized systems are vulnerable to manipulation

## 💡 Our Solution

QuantumChain introduces a blockchain-based system where:
- **Blockchain Immutability**: All quantum jobs are permanently recorded on the blockchain ledger
- **Tamper-Proof Security**: Cryptographic hashing prevents unauthorized modifications
- **User Verification**: Users can independently verify that computations haven't been altered
- **Complete Transparency**: Full audit trail of all quantum operations

## 🚀 Key Features
